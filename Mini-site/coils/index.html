    <h1>Pupin coils</h1>
    <img src="pupin-1916.jpg" alt="Pupin Image">
    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the<br>
        English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of<br>
        the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.<br>
        Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George<br>
        Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an<br>
        invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
